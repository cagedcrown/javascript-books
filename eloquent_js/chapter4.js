// Question 1: Write a range function that takes two arguments, start and end, and returns an array containing all the numbers from start up to (and including) end.

var range = function(start, end) {
  // do something
  // return
}

// Part 2: Next, write a sum function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of these numbers. Run the previous program and see whether it does indeed return 55.
